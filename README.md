# Number Guess Gauntlet

## About the Game

create a game where the challenger picks a number and the opponent guesses it.

## How to Play

1. One player (the Challenger) selects a secret number within a specified range.
2. The other player (the Guesser) submits guesses to try to find the secret number.
3. After each guess, feedback is given: too high, too low, or correct.
4. The Guesser continues until the correct number is found.
5. In Gauntlet mode, players compete head-to-head by taking turns as Challenger and Guesser to see who wins more rounds.
